# Mobile Automation

This repository contains Mobile Automation code written in Java.


### Environment & Setup

This project will be mostly focused on mobile automation with Appium, but as we continue our exploration of tools - there going to be other frameworks and libraries that we will be learning, ex: Cucumber + Calabash

In this section we will be mostly working with Android apps, because of some limitations of iOS, but definitely going to work with iOS as well.


### Builds

For our builds we are going to use one of the following build managers:

  -  Maven
  -  Gradle

It will all depend on a project, but the idea behind is to show how to use those tools.


### Libraries

We will be usign multiple 3rd party libraries:

  -  Appium Java client
  -  Apache Commons
  -  TestNG
  -  and some other libraries (see pom.xml or build.gradle)
