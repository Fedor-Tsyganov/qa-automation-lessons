# Web Automation

This repository contains Web Automation code written in Java. 

### Builds

For our builds we are going to use one of the following build managers:

  -  Maven
  -  Gradle

It will all depend on a project, but the idea behind is to show how to use those tools.

### Libraries

We will be usign multiple 3rd party libraries:

  -  Selenium WebDriver
  -  TestNG
  -  Apache Commons
  -  and some other libraries (see pom.xml or build.gradle)
